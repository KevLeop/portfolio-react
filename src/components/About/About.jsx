        <p>
          I'm 27 years old and I love programming, and seeing that projects turn
          out the way you want them. I am a graduate in Computer Science in the
          San Agust√≠n National University of Arequipa-Peru. <br />
          Actually I have a certified specialization in FullStack web
          development, Superior Technological Institute TECSUP.
